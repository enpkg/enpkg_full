Chromatographic separation was performed on a Vanquish Flex UPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) interfaced with a Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), using a heated electrospray ionization (HESI-II) source. Thermo Scientific Xcalibur 3.1 software was used for instrument control. The LC conditions were as follows: column, Waters BEH C18 100 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm; mobile phase, (A) water with 0.1% formic acid; (B) acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid; flow rate, 600 μL/min; injection volume, 2 μL; gradient, linear gradient of 2%−100% B over 10 min and isocratic at 100% B for 2 min. The optimized HESI-II parameters were as follows: source voltage, 3.5 kV (pos); sheath gas flow rate (N2), 55 units; auxiliary gas flow rate, 15 units; spare gas flow rate, 3.0; capillary temperature, 350°C, S-Lens RF Level, 50. The mass analyzer was calibrated using a mixture of caffeine, methionine–arginine–phenylalanine–alanine–acetate, sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium taurocholate, and Ultramark 1621 in an acetonitrile/methanol/water solution containing 1% formic acid by direct injection. The data-dependent tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) events were performed on the three most intense ions detected in full scan MS (Top3 experiment). The MS/MS isolation window width was 1 Da, and the stepped normalized collision energy was set to 15, 30, and 45 units. In data-dependent MS/MS experiments, full scans were acquired at a resolution of 35,000 Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) (at m/z 200) and MS/MS scans at 17,500 FWHM both with an automatically determined maximum injection time. After being acquired in an MS/MS scan, parent ions were placed in a dynamic exclusion list for 3.0 s.
